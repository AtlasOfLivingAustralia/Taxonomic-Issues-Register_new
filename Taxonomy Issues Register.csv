Different NSL Namespaces for different taxon IDs in ALA,,To Do,TAX-44,10124,"The identifiers that the ALA uses as species ids use multiple NSL URIs. The odd thing is that they come from different namespaces.

Mosses (AusMoss) are variously shown as ,  or  and lichens as  or .

"Taxonomic Backbone vs Data Match vs Name Matching - name matching not recognising italicised vs no italics, same words in different combinations e.g. authors etc",,To Do,TAX-39,10080,"Why are there two combinations each of P.p. phylicifolia and P. p. ericoides? This is our own doing. In the case of Pomaderris phylicifolia subsp. ericoides, in one instance, the subsp. Is italicised, ridiculously causing the name to fail to match when we've loaded threatened species lists so the name has been manually added a second time. Fortunately no data has followed it, purely, I think, because the data-matching ignores (I suspect) italics¦. But our name matching clear +does+ take it into account¦

In the case of Pomaderris phylicifolia subsp. phylicifolia, again this is a problem of our own doing. The names matching has failed to recognise the same author names in different author combinations (subsp. phylicifoliaLodd. ex Lin versus Lodd.exLinksubsp.phylicifolia) when loading conservation lists and as a consequence we've added a different combination, being PomaderrisphylicifoliaLodd.exLinksubsp.phylicifolia. What makes this particularly annoying is that our taxonomy is correct. All the data has correctly been attributed with Pomaderris phylicifolia subsp. phylicifolia, however 32 records have the authorship descriptor Lodd.
