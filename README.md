# Taxonomic-Issues-Register

## Test Cases

(Under construction)

Each issue in the register has a test case using
the most recent development version of ala-name-matching.
See the [pom.xml](pom.xml) for build information.

Each issue has a test case that can be run against
the issue to ensure that that problem does not re-occur.
In some cases, the test cases are annotated with `@Ignore`
to denote a query or unfixable problem.

The test cases are in files that group the test
cases by issue number.

The test cases are run against the 20230329-1 index.
